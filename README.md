QueryBuilder
============

Small PHP single class utility with no dependencies to build queries faster and safer.

The main goals are:

1. Keep it simple and small, this won't grow into an ORM!
2. Target repetitive tasks like inserts and updates from arrays.
3. Prevent common mistakes and SQL injections.
